Forest Fire Prediction with Explainable AI (XAI):
This project focuses on predicting forest fires using machine learning techniques. By analyzing environmental and climatic data, the model estimates the likelihood of fire occurrences. It encompasses data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and explainability through XAI techniques.

Features:
1)Data Processing & Preparation: Handles missing values, normalizes features, and selects significant variables.
2)Predictive Modeling: Employs machine learning algorithms to assess fire risks.
3)Explainability with XAI: Uses SHAP and LIME to provide insights into model decisions.
4)Performance Evaluation: Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure effectiveness.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of historical forest fire records along with environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation indices.

Results:
The trained model generates fire risk predictions, aiding early warning systems and disaster mitigation efforts. Explainability techniques highlight the key factors influencing predictions.

Future Improvements:
Incorporation of real-time weather data.
Expansion to multiple geographical areas.
Deployment as a web or mobile application.
