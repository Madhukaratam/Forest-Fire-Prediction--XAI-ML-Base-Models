# Forest-Fire-Prediction XAI ML Base Model

This project implements a Forest Fire Prediction Model using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes environmental and climatic data to predict the likelihood of forest fires. It includes data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and explainability using XAI techniques.

Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and selects relevant features.
Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning models to predict forest fire occurrences.
Explainable AI (XAI): Utilizes SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance assessment.

Dataset
The model uses a dataset containing historical forest fire records along with environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation index.

Results
The trained model provides fire risk predictions, which can be used for early warning systems and disaster prevention. Explainability methods offer insights into key contributing factors.

Future Enhancements
Integration of real-time weather data.
Expansion to cover different geographical regions.
Deployment as a web or mobile application.
